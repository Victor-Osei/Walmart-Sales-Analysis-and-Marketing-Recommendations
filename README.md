## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Understanding
Goal: Analyze Walmart‚Äôs weekly sales to identify factors influencing sales and recommend strategies to increase sales.

Objectives:

Evaluate the impact of holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment on sales.

Compare store-specific performance to identify high and low performers.

Identify seasonality and trends in sales.

Provide actionable marketing and operational recommendations.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding
Your dataset (Walmart_sales_analysis.csv) contains:

- Store: Store number

- Date: Week start date

- Weekly_Sales: Sales for the week

- Holiday_Flag: 1 if the week includes a major holiday, else 0

- Temperature: Average temperature for the week

- Fuel_Price: Fuel price in the region

- CPI: Consumer Price Index

- Unemployment: Unemployment rate


‚úÖ Check missing values and data types
‚úÖ Summarize data statistics
‚úÖ Visualize distributions and correlations


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
Convert Date to datetime format.

Create Year, Month, Week features.

Check for and handle missing values if present.

Check outliers using IQR or Z-scores for Weekly_Sales, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment.

Normalize/scale variables if needed for modeling.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling
We will not build predictive ML models for now, but:
‚úÖ Perform hypothesis testing
‚úÖ Use statistical tests to check relationships and significance

* Hypothesis Testing
Holiday Impact:

Null (H0): Holidays do not significantly impact weekly sales.

Alternate (H1): Holidays significantly increase weekly sales.

Using two-sample t-test between holiday and non-holiday weeks.


## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
Insights will be evaluated for business relevance:
